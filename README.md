## About the Challenge

DJI is a world leader in aerial robotics and imaging systems. For the last five years it has put on the RoboMaster competition in Shenzhen, China. Teams of robots battle across an arena to destroy the enemy base and complete technical challenges. The main unit on the field is called a rover, and much of the hardware for this vehicle is supplied by RoboMaster. In the tournament, these four wheeled rovers are operated by human pilot. They have a launcher which is used to fire small 17mm plastic projectiles at the opposing team. To visit past games and introductory videos here. To see the RoboMaster promotional video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI2uoV58pzQ&feature=youtu.be).

ICRAâ€™s RoboMaster challenge asks teams to use the same hardware to build one or a pair of these rovers. Instead of human pilots, these rovers must be fully autonomous. The AI challenge asks teams to build rovers that can sense the environment around themselves, navigate an arena, and engage in combat with the opposing team. Rovers will need to move around the battlefield, a five by eight meter space, launching projectiles and trying to avoid incoming hits. At the end of match, the team that has scored the most hits on their opponents will be declared the winner. The grand prize winner will receive a $20,000 prize.

Teams purchase hardware from RoboMaster and code their own autonomous systems. After signing up, teams must submit photos, videos, and documentation that track their progress. Teams that demonstrate their ability to design fully functioning and autonomous rover units will qualify for the competition.
